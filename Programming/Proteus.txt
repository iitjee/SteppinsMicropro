/**
  *Proteus is a simulation platform for different micro-controllers.
  
  STEPS:
  * Write and compile your code in Keil uVision (this gives you the desired HEX file).
  * Debug your code in Keil (optional) just to make sure it works the way you expect it to.
  * Simulate the whole project in Proteus.
  
  USING PROTEUS:
  Select and place components using the library.
  Connect all the components as required.
  * Load HEX file (if youâ€™re using micro-controller).
  * Simulate!
